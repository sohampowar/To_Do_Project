        The To-Do Task Manager is a simple yet powerful web application designed to help users organize their daily activities efficiently. This project allows users to add, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed, all within a clean and responsive user interface. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend is powered by Python and the Django framework, with SQLite used as the database. Bootstrap has been used to ensure the design is responsive and user-friendly across all devices.

        The goal of this project is to provide a minimalistic yet effective task management tool that helps users stay productive and focused. Users can easily manage their to-do lists by creating tasks with a title and description, updating them when needed, and marking them as completed once done. All completed and pending tasks are displayed separately for better clarity.
        
        As the sole developer of this project, I was responsible for designing the database schema, creating dynamic templates, writing the backend logic using Django views, and connecting everything through URLs and forms. This project also makes use of Djangoâ€™s admin panel for task management during development.
        
        In the future, this application can be enhanced by adding features like user authentication for personalized task lists, setting due dates and priorities for tasks, search and filter functionality, and even calendar or notification integrations.</p>
